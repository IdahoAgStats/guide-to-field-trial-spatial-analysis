The goal of variety testing programs is to provide the agricultural industry reliable information about regional crop variety performance. Crop variety trials employ common experimental designs such as randomized complete block design to account for environmental heterogeneity. However, those techniques are quite often inadequate to fully account for spatial heterogeneity that arises due to field position, soil conditions, disease, wildlife impacts and more. # need to insert image As a result, the assumption of ANOVA are violated, invalidating the analysis, and variety estimates themselves are incorrect. Incorporating spatial correlation between experimental plots can improve the overall accuracy and precision of these estimates. 2.2 Diagnosing spatial auto-correlation Spatial correlation is similarity of plots that are close to one another. That correlation is expected to decline with distance. This is different from experiment-wide gradients, such as a salinity gradient or position on a slope. 2.2.1 Morans I Morans I, sometimes called Global Morans I is similar like a correlation coefficient. It is a test for correlation between units (plots in our case). \\[ I = \\frac{N}{W}\\frac{\\sum_i \\sum_j w_{ij} (x_i - \\bar{x})(x_j - \\bar{x})}{\\sum_i(x_i - \\bar{x})^2} \\qquad i \\neq j\\] Where N is total number of spatial locations indexed by \\(i\\) and \\(j\\), x is the variable of interest, \\(w_{ij}\\) are a spatial weights between each \\(i\\) and \\(j\\), and W is the sum of all weights. The expected values of Morans I is \\(-1/(N-1)\\). Values greater than that indicate positive spatial correlation (areas close to each other are similar), while values less than the expected Morans I indicate dissimilarity as spatial distance between points decreases. There are several options for defining adjacent neighbors and how to weight each neighbors influence. The two common configurations for defining neighbors are the rook and queen configurations. These are exactly what their chess analogy suggest: rook defines neighbors in an row/column fashion, while queen defines neighbors in a row/column configuration an also neighbors located diagonally at a 45 degree angle from the row/column neighbors. Determining this can be somewhat complicated when working with irregularly-placed data (e.g. county seats), but is quite unambiguous for lattice data common in planned field experiments: Another test for diagnosing spatial correlation is Gearys C: \\[ I = \\frac{(N -1)}{2W}\\frac{\\sum_i \\sum_j w_{ij} (x_i - x_j)^2}{\\sum_i(x_i - \\bar{x})^2} \\qquad i \\neq j\\] These terms have the same meaning in Morans I. The expected value of Gearys C is 1. Values higher than 1 indicate positive spatial correlation and less than 1 indicate negative spatial correlation. 2.2.2 Empirical variogram &amp; semivariance An empirical variogram is a visual tool for understanding how error terms are related to each other over spatial distance. It relies on semivariance (\\(\\gamma\\)), a statistic expressing variance as a function of pairwise distances between data points at points \\(i\\) and \\(j\\). \\[\\gamma(h) = \\frac{1}{2|N(h)|}\\sum_{N(h)}(x_i - x_j)^2\\] Semivariances are binned for distance intervals. The average values for semivariance and distance interval can be fit to correlated error models such a exponential, spherical, Gaussian and Matérn. How to do this is explored further in 3 of this guide. Three important concepts of an empirical variogram are nugget, sill and range Example Empirical Variogram range = distance up to which is there is spatial correlation sill = uncorrelated variance of the variable of interest nugget = measurement error, or short-distance spatial variance and other unaccounted for variance 2 other concepts: partial sill = sill - nugget nugget effect = the nugget/sill ratio, interpreted opposite of \\(r^2\\) "],["background.html", "Section 3 Spatial Models 3.1 Correlated error models 3.2 Spatial Regression methods 3.3 Trend analysis", " Section 3 Spatial Models This section contains some of the background behind why spatial models are used and how they work. Understanding this section is not essential, but it is extremely helpful. This section relies on information introduced in 2, so please make sure you have read that section if you are new to empirical variograms and spatial statistics. General linear statistical models are commonly modeled as thus: \\[Y_i = \\beta_0 + X_i\\beta_1 + \\epsilon_i\\] \\(\\beta_1\\) is a slope describing the relationship between a continuous variable and the dependent variable, \\(Y_i\\). If \\(X_i\\) is a categorical variable, such as a crop variety, then there will be \\(p-1\\) slopes estimated, where p is the number of unique treatments levels in \\(X\\). The error terms, \\(\\epsilon_i\\) are assumed normally distributed with a mean of zero and a variance of \\(\\sigma^2\\) : \\[e_i ~\\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\] The error terms, or residuals, are assumed to be identically and independently distributed (sometimes abbreviated iid). This implies a constant variance of the error terms and zero covariance between residuals. If N = 3, the expanded model looks like this: \\[\\left[ {\\begin{array}{ccc} Y_1\\\\ Y_2\\\\ Y_3 \\end{array} } \\right] = \\beta_0 + \\left[ {\\begin{array}{ccc} X_1\\\\ X_2\\\\ X_3 \\end{array} } \\right] \\beta_1 + \\left[ {\\begin{array}{ccc} \\epsilon_1\\\\ \\epsilon_2\\\\ \\epsilon_3 \\end{array} } \\right] \\] \\[e_i ~\\sim N \\Bigg( 0, \\left[ {\\begin{array}{ccc} \\sigma^2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; \\sigma^2 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\sigma^2\\end{array} } \\right] \\Bigg) \\] If spatial variation is present, the off-diagonals of the variance-covariance matrix are not zero - hence the error terms are not independently distributed. As a result, hypotheses test and parameter estimates from uncorrected linear models will provide erroneous results. 3.1 Correlated error models 3.1.1 Distance-based correlation error models There are mathematical tools for modelling how error terms are correlated with each other based on pairwise physical distance between observations. These models can be used to weight observations. Often, the data are assumed to be isotropic, where distance but not direction impacts the spatial error correlation. There are several methods for estimating the semivariance as a direct function of distance. 3.1.1.1 Exponential \\[ \\gamma (h)\\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{cc} 0 &amp; h = 0\\\\ C_0+C_1 \\left [ 1-e^{-(\\frac{h}{r})} \\right] &amp; h &gt; 0 \\end{array} } \\right. \\] where \\[ C_0 = nugget \\\\ C_1 = partial \\: sill \\\\ r = range\\] Figure 3.1: Exponential Model \\(3r = r_p\\) is the practical range, which is 95% of the true value for \\(C_1\\). 3.1.1.2 Gaussian (a squared version of the exponential model) \\[ \\gamma (h)\\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{cc} 0 &amp; h = 0\\\\ C_0+C_1 \\left [ 1-e^{-(\\frac{h}{r})^2} \\right] &amp; h &gt; 0 \\end{array} } \\right. \\] where \\[ C_0 = nugget \\\\ C_1 = partial \\: sill \\\\ r = range\\] Figure 3.2: Gaussian Model \\(\\sqrt 3r = r_p\\) is the practical range, which is 95% of the true value for \\(C_1\\). 3.1.1.3 Spherical \\[ \\gamma (h) = \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{cc} 0 &amp; h = 0\\\\ C_0+C_1 \\left[ \\frac{3h}{2r}-0.5\\bigg( \\frac{h}{r}\\bigg)^3 \\right] &amp; 0 &lt;h \\leq r \\\\ C_0 + C_1 &amp; h &gt; r \\end{array} } \\right. \\] where \\[ C_0 = nugget \\\\ C_1 = partial \\: sill \\\\ r = range\\] Figure 3.3: Spherical Model 3.1.1.4 Other correlated error distance models There are many more models - Matérn, Cauchy, Logistic - that may describe spatial correlation in a data set. There are two addition models that have no range or sill, the linear model and power model. If your data fits these, consider doing a trend analysis. 3.1.1.5 Linear \\[ \\gamma (h)=\\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{cc} 0 &amp; h = 0\\\\ C_0+C_1h &amp; h &gt; 0 \\end{array} } \\right. \\] where \\[ C_0 = nugget \\\\ C_1 = slope \\] Figure 3.4: Linear Error Model There is no sill or range in the linear model, so the variance will continue to increase as a function of distance. 3.1.1.6 Power \\[ \\gamma (h)=\\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{cc} 0 &amp; h = 0\\\\ C_0+C_1h^\\lambda &amp; h &gt; 0 \\end{array} } \\right. \\] where \\[ 0 \\leq \\lambda &lt;\\leq 2 \\\\ C_0 = nugget \\\\ C_1 = scaling \\: factor \\] Figure 3.5: Power Model When \\(\\lambda = 1\\), that is equivalent to the linear model. Example above is when \\(\\lambda = 0.5\\) (i.e. a square-root transformation) and \\(C_1 = 1\\). There is also no sill or range in the power model. 3.1.1.7 Matérn \\[\\gamma(h) = c_0 + c_1 \\bigg( 1- \\frac{1}{2^{\\kappa -1}\\Gamma(\\kappa)} \\Big( \\frac{h}{\\alpha} \\Big) ^{\\kappa} K_\\kappa \\Big( \\frac{h}{\\alpha} \\Big) \\bigg)\\] Where \\[ C_0 = nugget \\\\ C_1 = partial \\: scale \\\\ \\alpha = smoothing \\: factor \\\\ \\kappa = covariance \\: parameter \\] \\(\\Gamma(\\kappa)\\) is the gamma function: \\[\\Gamma(\\kappa) = (\\kappa -1)!\\] and \\(\\kappa(\\alpha)\\) is a modified bessel function: \\[ K_\\kappa(t) = \\frac{\\Gamma(\\alpha)}{2} \\big( \\frac{t}{2} \\big) ^{-\\kappa}\\] 3.1.2 Correlated error model for gridded data Planned field experiments often have the advantage of being arranged in regular grid pattern that can be adequately described using Euclidean space. This simplifies aspects of understanding how error terms are related by distance since the data occur in evenly spaced increments. Furthermore, in many agricultural trials, there may be no interest in spatial interpolation between units. Some of the following models work with irregularly-spaced data, but the models below are simplified forms when the experimental units are arranged in regular grid. For example, imagine an experiment consisting of 8 plots (plot = the experiment units) arranged in 2 rows, each with 4 ranges with this layout: The statistical model for that experiment: \\[ \\left[ {\\begin{array} \\ Y_1 \\\\ Y_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ Y_n \\end{array} } \\right] = \\beta_0 + \\left[ {\\begin{array} \\ X_1 \\\\ X_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ X_n \\end{array} } \\right] \\beta_1 + \\left[ {\\begin{array} \\ \\epsilon_1 \\\\ \\epsilon_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\epsilon_n \\end{array} } \\right] \\] \\(X\\beta\\) refer to independent variable effects. This same model is also often presented in an abbreviated matrix form: \\[ \\mathbf{Y = X\\beta + \\epsilon}\\] 3.1.2.1 First order auto-regressive model (AR1) This assumes that variance can be modelled as exponential function based on unit distance (e.g. row or range), either in a single direction or anistropic. The AR1 structure across 2 rows is modeled as thus: \\[\\mathbf { V_{AR(1)row}} = \\sigma^2 \\left[ {\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; \\rho \\\\ \\rho &amp; 1 \\end{array} } \\right] \\otimes \\mathbf{I_4} \\] This covariance model describes the correlation of observations in the row direction only. And similarly the AR1 structure across 4 ranges is modeled as thus: \\[ \\mathbf {V_{AR(1)range}} = \\sigma^2 \\mathbf{I_4} \\otimes \\left[ {\\begin{array}{cccc} 1 &amp; \\rho &amp; \\rho^2 &amp; \\rho^3 \\\\ \\rho &amp; 1 &amp; \\rho &amp; \\rho^2 \\\\ \\rho^2 &amp; \\rho &amp; 1 &amp; \\rho \\\\ \\rho^3 &amp; \\rho^2 &amp; \\rho &amp; 1 \\end{array} } \\right] \\] This covariance model describes the correlation of observations in the range direction only. In combined AR1xAR1 model, the parameter, \\(\\rho\\) may need to estimated separated across the row and column directions depending on the shape of the plots and site-specific field variation. Very rectangular plots are likely to require a separate estimate of the \\(\\rho\\) parameter for each direction. $$ = ^2 $$ Note: \\(\\rho_1\\) and \\(\\rho_2\\) are the parameter estimate for \\(V_{AR1(1) row}\\) and \\(V_{AR(1)range}\\), respectively. Please note that these error models are for modelling localised variation based on physical proximity. It is assumed that eventually a distance in the experiment can be reached in which 2 observations can be treated independent. If there are spatial trends that extend along the entire scope of an experiment (for instance, due to position on a slope), then an additional trend analysis should be conducted. 3.2 Spatial Regression methods These approaches look use information from adjacent plots to adjust for spatial auto-correlation. 3.2.1 Spatial autoregressive (SAR) Sometimes called a lag model, the SAR model uses correlations with neighboring plots dependent variable to predict Y. The auto-regressive model explicitly models correlations between neighboring points. \\[\\mathbf{Y = \\rho W Y + X\\beta + \\epsilon} \\] While this may look strange, \\(\\mathbf{W}\\) is an \\(n\\) x \\(n\\) matrix weighting the neighbors with a diagonal of zero so the value at \\(i=j\\), that is \\(Y_{ijk}\\) itself, is not used on the right-hand side to predict \\(Y_{ijk}\\) on the left-hand side of the equation. The error terms are assumed iid. On Weights Setting weights of neighbors is dealt with in the next chapter 5. 3.3 Trend analysis 3.3.1 Row and column trends Experiment wide-trends should be modeled with directional trend models. These are comparatively simple models: \\[Y_{ijk} = \\beta_0 + X_{i1}\\beta_1 + Row_{j2}\\beta_2 + Range_{k3}\\beta_3 +\\epsilon_{ijk}\\] If the assumption of independent, normal, and identical errors are met, then this model will suffice. If spatial variation is still present, additional measures will need to be taken. 3.3.2 Splines There is a rich field of research on using localised splines to model field heterogeneity. These models are complex and hence not described here.

In this example, only adjacent neighbors in the rook formation (see 3) are used and are weighted proportionally according to their representation as neighbors to an individual. That is, if a unit has 4 adjacent neighbors, each neighbor is weighted as 0.25. If there are only two neighbors, each is weighted 0.5. The function cell2nb() is a function for setting neighbors when working with data laid out in a regular grid. library(spdep) xy_rook &lt;- cell2nb(nrow = max(Nin$row), ncol = max(Nin$col), type=&quot;rook&quot;, torus = FALSE, legacy = FALSE) Make sure your data sorted by the variables assigned to row and col (in that order), and there is one and only one observation in the data set for each unique row/col combination.

It cannot be used it for the NIN data set because it contains empty plots between each block with no data available for those plots. 4.3 Empirical variogram fitting First, create a spatial object by adding spatial coordinates to an ordinary data frame.

As such, isotropic models (where spatial correlation is based on distance but not direction) are often adequate for understanding localised field heterogeneity. However, there are always exceptions where a spatial correlation in a field trail is best describe by an anistropic model. Reestablish models for variogram fitting: Nin_vgm1a &lt;- vgm(model = &quot;Exp&quot;, anis = c(90, 0.5)) # 90 refers to the angle of the main direction and 0.5 creates a second 90 degree axis of variability to estimate Nin_vgm2a &lt;- vgm(model = &quot;Sph&quot;, anis = c(90, 0.5)) Nin_vgm3a &lt;- vgm(model = &quot;Gau&quot;, anis = c(90, 0.5)) Nin_vgm4a &lt;- vgm(model = &quot;Mat&quot;, anis = c(90, 0.5)) Fit the variograms to the data: Nin_variofit1a &lt;- fit.variogram(resid_var1, Nin_vgm1a) Nin_variofit2a &lt;- fit.variogram(resid_var1, Nin_vgm2a) Nin_variofit3a &lt;- fit.variogram(resid_var1, Nin_vgm3a) Nin_variofit4a &lt;- fit.variogram(resid_var1, Nin_vgm4a, fit.kappa = T) print(&quot;Exponential&quot;); attr(Nin_variofit1a, &quot;SSErr&quot;) ## [1] &quot;Exponential&quot; ## [1] 8387.429 print(&quot;Spherical&quot;); attr(Nin_variofit2a, &quot;SSErr&quot;) ## [1] &quot;Spherical&quot; ## [1] 9448.75 print(&quot;Gaussian&quot;); attr(Nin_variofit3a, &quot;SSErr&quot;) ## [1] &quot;Gaussian&quot; ## [1] 19319.19 print(&quot;Matern&quot;); attr(Nin_variofit4a, &quot;SSErr&quot;) ## [1] &quot;Matern&quot; ## [1] 7253.594 Error terms are considerably higher than in the isotropic model. plot(resid_var1, Nin_variofit1a, main = &quot;Exponential model&quot;) Hmm, that plot is not very convincing. In this field trial, there is evidence of spatial correlation as a function of distance, but there is not evidence this spatial correlation is impacted by direction. Another reminder on field trends Its important to remember these methods are intended to describe localised spatial correlation. Field-wide spatial gradients, such as position on a slope, should be modelled as a separate trend.

Several techniques are explored: Load data if it is not already in your R environment: library(agridat); library(dplyr); library(tidyr); library(purrr); library(sp) data(&quot;stroup.nin&quot;) Nin &lt;- stroup.nin %&gt;% mutate(col.width = col * 1.2, row.length = row * 4.3) %&gt;% fill(rep, .direction = &quot;up&quot;) %&gt;% arrange(col, row) Nin_na &lt;- filter(Nin, !is.na(yield)) Nin_spatial &lt;- Nin_na coordinates(Nin_spatial) &lt;- ~ col.width + row.length Once spatial auto-correlation has been identified in field trials, the next step is to employ a modeling technique that will reduce the impact of spatial variation on the final estimates from the analysis. 5.1 Prep work The first thing is to run a standard linear model. A common model specification for the randomized complete block design (RCBD) is to include cultivar as a fixed effect and block as a random effect. library(nlme); library(emmeans) nin_lme &lt;- lme(yield ~ gen, random = ~1|rep, data = Nin, na.action = na.exclude) # extract the least squares means for variety preds_lme &lt;- as.data.frame(emmeans(nin_lme, &quot;gen&quot;)) The variables gen refers to the cultivar or breeding line being trialed, and rep is the block, and the dependent variable, yield is grain yield. Basic exploratory analysis of this data set was conducted in 4. 5.2 Correlated errors Gaussian Example In order to fit models using correlated error model, we will need to first obtain preliminary estimates of the nugget, sill and range: from fitting an empirical variogram. library(gstat) max_dist &lt;- 0.6*max(dist(coordinates(Nin_spatial))) resid.var1 &lt;- variogram(yield ~ rep + gen, cutoff = max_dist, width = max_dist/10, data = Nin_spatial) nugget_start &lt;- min(resid.var1$gamma) In the previous section, an isotropic Gaussian function was identified as the best model for describing the decay of error correlations over distance. nin_vgm &lt;- vgm(model = &quot;Gau&quot;, nugget = nugget_start) nin_variofit &lt;- fit.variogram(resid.var1, nin_vgm) nugget &lt;- nin_variofit$psill[1] range &lt;- nin_variofit$range[2] sill &lt;- sum(nin_variofit$psill) nugget.effect &lt;- nugget/sill Create a correlated error structure using the nlme package. cor.gaus &lt;- corSpatial(value = c(range, nugget.effect), form = ~ row.length + col.width, nugget = T, fixed = F, type = &quot;gaussian&quot;, metric = &quot;euclidean&quot;) Update the linear mixed model with the correlated error structure: nin_gaus &lt;- update(nin_lme, corr = cor.gaus) Extract variety estimates: preds_gaus &lt;- as.data.frame(emmeans(nin_gaus, &quot;gen&quot;)) Other models can be implemented following this template. 5.2.1 Exponential rm(nin_vgm, nin_variofit, nugget, sill, range, nugget.effect) nin_vgm &lt;- vgm(model = &quot;Exp&quot;, nugget = nugget_start) nin_variofit &lt;- fit.variogram(resid.var1, nin_vgm) nugget &lt;- nin_variofit$psill[1] range &lt;- nin_variofit$range[2] sill &lt;- sum(nin_variofit$psill) nugget.effect &lt;- nugget/sill cor.exp &lt;- corSpatial(value = c(range, nugget.effect), form = ~ row.length + col.width, nugget = T, fixed = F, type = &quot;exponential&quot;, metric = &quot;euclidean&quot;) nin_exp &lt;- update(nin_lme, corr = cor.exp) preds_exp &lt;- as.data.frame(emmeans(nin_exp, &quot;gen&quot;)) 5.2.2 Spherical rm(nin_vgm, nin_variofit, nugget, sill, range, nugget.effect) nin_vgm &lt;- vgm(model = &quot;Sph&quot;, nugget = nugget_start) nin_variofit &lt;- fit.variogram(resid.var1, nin_vgm) nugget &lt;- nin_variofit$psill[1] range &lt;- nin_variofit$range[2] sill &lt;- sum(nin_variofit$psill) nugget.effect &lt;- nugget/sill cor.sph &lt;- corSpatial(value = c(range, nugget.effect), form = ~ row.length + col.width, nugget = T, fixed = F, type = &quot;spherical&quot;, metric = &quot;euclidean&quot;) nin_sph &lt;- update(nin_lme, corr = cor.sph) preds_sph &lt;- as.data.frame(emmeans(nin_sph, &quot;gen&quot;)) 5.2.3 Power rm(nin_vgm, nin_variofit, nugget, sill, range, nugget.effect) cor.pow &lt;- corSpatial(form = ~ row.length + col.width, nugget = T, fixed = F, type = &quot;ratio&quot;, metric = &quot;euclidean&quot;) nin_pow &lt;- update(nin_lme, corr = cor.pow) preds_pow &lt;- as.data.frame(emmeans(nin_pow, &quot;gen&quot;)) 5.2.4 Matérn A Matern error function is not available in nlme, but the packge spaMM has written an extension implementing the Matérn, Cauchy and other covariance structures. The Matérn is demonstrated below. rm(nin_vgm, nin_variofit, nugget, sill, range, nugget.effect) library(spaMM) # required for running `corMatern()` nin_vgm &lt;- vgm(model = &quot;Mat&quot;, nugget = nugget_start) nin_variofit &lt;- fit.variogram(resid.var1, nin_vgm, fit.kappa = TRUE) nugget &lt;- nin_variofit$psill[1] range &lt;- nin_variofit$range[2] sill &lt;- sum(nin_variofit$psill) nugget.effect &lt;- nugget/sill kappa &lt;- nin_variofit$kappa[2] # from spAMM documentation: &quot;Warning: the range parameter used in corSpatial objects is the inverse of the scale parameter used in MaternCorr and thus they have opposite meaning despite both being denoted  elsewhere in this package or in nlme literature&quot; - so range is expressed as an inverse cor.mat &lt;- corMatern(value = c(1/range, kappa, nugget.effect), form = ~ row.length + col.width, nugget = T, fixed = F, metric = &quot;euclidean&quot;) nin_matern &lt;- update(nin_lme, corr = cor.mat) preds_mat &lt;- as.data.frame(emmeans(nin_matern, &quot;gen&quot;)) In the nlme package, there is also an option for a linear model in the corSpatial() function. However, if a linear trend is present without a range or sill, it is recommended that a linear trend be fitted to the data instead. 5.3 Row/Column Trends: The package lme4 is used since it can handle multiple random effects while nlme cannot do this without nesting the effects. I prefer nlme for linear modeling in this tutorial because of its built-in functionality for including spatial variation. library(lme4) ## Loading required package: Matrix ## ## Attaching package: &#39;Matrix&#39; ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:tidyr&#39;: ## ## expand, pack, unpack ## ## Attaching package: &#39;lme4&#39; ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:nlme&#39;: ## ## lmList # variables specifying row and column as factors are needed Nin$colF &lt;- as.factor(Nin$col) Nin$rowF &lt;- as.factor(Nin$row) nin_trend &lt;- lmer(yield ~ gen + (1|rep) + (1|colF) + (1|rowF), data = Nin, na.action = na.exclude) # extract the least squares means for variety preds_trend &lt;- as.data.frame(emmeans(nin_trend, &quot;gen&quot;)) 5.4 Splines The package SpATS, spatial analysis for field trials, implements B-splines for row and column effects. library(SpATS) nin_spline &lt;- SpATS(response = &quot;yield&quot;, spatial = ~ PSANOVA(col, row, nseg = c(10,20), degree = 3, pord = 2), genotype = &quot;gen&quot;, random = ~ rep, # + rowF + colF, data = Nin, control = list(tolerance = 1e-03, monitoring = 0)) preds_spline &lt;- predict(nin_spline, which = &quot;gen&quot;) %&gt;% dplyr::select(gen, emmean = &quot;predicted.values&quot;, SE = &quot;standard.errors&quot;) 5.5 Bayesian AR1xAR1 ## library(INLA) ## also need to add model info... 5.6 Model Selection Now that we have built these spatial models, how do we pick the right one? Unfortunately, there is no one model that works best in all circumstances. In addition, there is no single way for choosing the best model! Some appraoches include: comparing model fitness (e.g. AIC, BIC, log likelihood) comparing posthoc power (that is, the p-values for the treatments) comparing standard error of the estimates In order to make comparisons, the code below assembles all the model objects into one list. They are generated from different processes, as shown by the class attribute of each one, so this takes some data conditioning. all.models &lt;- mget(ls(pattern = &quot;^nin_*&quot;)) # print out their class map(all.models, class) ## $nin.lme ## [1] &quot;lme&quot; ## ## $nin_exp ## [1] &quot;lme&quot; ## ## $nin_gaus ## [1] &quot;lme&quot; ## ## $nin_lme ## [1] &quot;lme&quot; ## ## $nin_matern ## [1] &quot;lme&quot; ## ## $nin_pow ## [1] &quot;lme&quot; ## ## $nin_sph ## [1] &quot;lme&quot; ## ## $nin_spline ## [1] &quot;SpATS&quot; ## ## $nin_trend ## [1] &quot;lmerMod&quot; ## attr(,&quot;package&quot;) ## [1] &quot;lme4&quot; 5.6.1 Spatial dependence of residuals It would be helpful to know if these methods were effective in reducing the spatial dependence among the error residuals. The function below extracts the residuals from each model and is needed because of different handling of missing values by the package SpATS. L1 &lt;- nrow(Nin) non_na &lt;- !is.na(Nin$yield) L2 &lt;- sum(non_na) residuals &lt;- map(all.models, function (x) { resids &lt;- residuals(x) if(is.data.frame(resids)) { colnum = ncol(resids) resids = resids[,colnum] } if(length(resids) == L2) { resids_pl = rep(NA, L1) resids_pl[non_na] = resids resids = resids_pl } return(resids) }) names(residuals) &lt;- names(all.models) Run a Morans I test on the extracted residuals: library(spdep) xy.rook &lt;- cell2nb(nrow = max(Nin$row), ncol = max(Nin$col), type=&quot;rook&quot;) Moran.I &lt;- map_df(residuals, function(x) { mi = moran.test(x, nb2listw(xy.rook), na.action = na.exclude) mi.stat &lt;- mi$estimate mi.stat$p.value &lt;- mi$p.value return(mi.stat) }) %&gt;% mutate(model = names(all.models)) %&gt;% dplyr::select(c(5, 1:4)) %&gt;% mutate_at(2:5, round, 4) %&gt;% arrange(p.value) Moran.I ## # A tibble: 9 x 5 ## model `Moran I statistic` Expectation Variance p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 nin.lme 0.402 -0.0045 0.0025 0 ## 2 nin_exp 0.756 -0.0045 0.0025 0 ## 3 nin_gaus 0.760 -0.0045 0.0025 0 ## 4 nin_lme 0.402 -0.0045 0.0025 0 ## 5 nin_matern 0.760 -0.0045 0.0025 0 ## 6 nin_pow 0.760 -0.0045 0.0025 0 ## 7 nin_sph 0.757 -0.0045 0.0025 0 ## 8 nin_trend 0.132 -0.0045 0.0025 0.0032 ## 9 nin_spline -0.0514 -0.0045 0.0025 0.826 Only one model, nin_spline resulted in an improvement in Morans I. Nearest neighbor approaches can also improve Morans I. The significant p-values indicate that auto-correlation is still present in those models. However, that doesnt mean the other models are ineffective. The other models incorporate the spatial auto-correlation directly into the error terms. 5.6.2 Compare Model Fit log likelihood, AIC, BIC Since these are not nested models, likelihood ratio tests cannot be performed. Log likelihood can be compared within the models from nlme but not across packages since they use different estimation procedures. nlme_mods &lt;- list(nin_lme, nin_exp, nin_gaus, nin_sph, nin_pow, nin_matern, nin_trend) names(nlme_mods) &lt;- c(c(&quot;LMM&quot;, &quot;exponential&quot;, &quot;gaussian&quot;, &quot;spherical&quot;, &quot;power&quot;, &quot;matern&quot;, &quot;row-col_trend&quot;)) data.frame(loglikihood = sapply(nlme_mods, logLik), AIC = sapply(nlme_mods, AIC), BIC = sapply(nlme_mods, AIC, k = log(nrow(Nin_na)))) ## loglikihood AIC BIC ## LMM -608.8508 1333.702 1531.577 ## exponential -543.0149 1206.030 1410.729 ## gaussian -540.3401 1200.680 1405.379 ## spherical -541.7560 1203.512 1408.211 ## power -540.8889 1201.778 1406.477 ## matern -540.3386 1202.677 1410.788 ## row-col_trend -577.6523 1275.305 1480.003 Larger log likelihoods indicate a better fitting model to the data. A rule of thumb when comparing log likelihoods is that differences less than 2 are not considered notable. These results suggest that the Gaussian, spherical, power and Matérn models are substantially equivalent in capturing the variation present in this data set. 5.6.3 Experiment-wide error exp_error &lt;- as.data.frame(sapply(nlme_mods, sigma)) exp_error ## sapply(nlme_mods, sigma) ## LMM 7.041475 ## exponential 8.967355 ## gaussian 8.035251 ## spherical 7.946038 ## power 8.934250 ## matern 8.061689 ## row-col_trend 4.754971 The overall experimental error, \\(\\sigma\\), increased slightly in the correlated error models because field variation has been re-partitioned to the error when it was (erroneously) absorbed by the other experimental effects. As a result, the coefficient of variation is not a good metric for evaluating the quality of spatial models.

There is some consistency in the rankings between exponential, Gaussian, power, Matérn, and spherical covariance models. The control RCBD model, lme, has fundamentally different rankings. The spline and AR1xAR1 ranking are also sightly different from the other models. Nevertheless, the following plot indicates considerable consensus in the least squares means from all of the spatial models. The upper diagonal contains Pearson correlations between those values. Figure 5.3: Correlations in Variety Means 5.7 Making decisions There is no consensus on how to pick the best model. Some studies rely on log likelihood, while others seek to maximize the experimental power. Others have sought to minimize the root mean square error from cross validation. The evidence suggest that for this data set, using any spatial model is better than running a naïve RCBD model.

The data represent yields of 56 varieties originally layed out in a randomized complete block design (RCB). The local topography combined with winter kill, however, induced spatial variability that did not correspond to the RCB design (Stroup 2013) which produced biased estimates in a standard unadjusted analysis. The code below reads the data from a CSV file where missing values for yield are denoted as NA. These values are not actually missing, but represent blank plots in the original design of the study. The PROC FORMAT section converts these to numeric missing values in SAS (defined as a single period). They are then removed from the data before proceeding to analyses. Also note that row and column indices are multiplied by constants to convert them to the meter dimensions of the plots. This CSV data file can be downloaded here The first six observations are displayed. The data contains variables for variety (gen), replication (rep), yield, and column and row identifiers.

This code uses the SGPLOT procedure to examine spatial patterns through a heat map of yields, as well as potential trends across replications, columns, and rows using box plots. ODS html GPATH = &quot;.\\img\\&quot; ; proc sgplot data=alliance; HEATMAPPARM y=Row x=Col COLORRESPONSE=yield/ colormodel=(blue yellow green); run; proc sgplot data=alliance; vbox yield/category=rep FILLATTRS=(color=red) LINEATTRS=(color=black) WHISKERATTRS=(color=black); run; proc sgplot data=alliance; vbox yield/category=Col FILLATTRS=(color=yellow) LINEATTRS=(color=black) WHISKERATTRS=(color=black); run; proc sgplot data=alliance; vbox yield/category=Row FILLATTRS=(color=blue) LINEATTRS=(color=black) WHISKERATTRS=(color=black); run; In the heat map, there is a notable region where yield dips in the north west corner of the study area. This area runs across the two top most blocks and is positioned towards their ends, making those blocks non-homogeneous. As Stroup (Stroup 2013) notes, this is due to a hilly area with low snow cover and high exposure to low winter temperatures. The box plots demonstrate this pattern across blocks, columns, and rows as well. From these initial graphics, it is clear there is discernible spatial patterns and trends present. 6.2 Estimating and Testing Spatial Correlation 6.2.1 Examine the Number of Distance Pairs and Maximum Lags between Residuals The process of modeling spatial variability begins by obtaining the residuals from the original RCB analysis. Here PROC MIXED is used to fit the RCB model and output the model residuals to the SAS data set residuals. ods html close; proc mixed data=alliance; class Rep Entry; model Yield = Entry / outp=residuals; random Rep; run; ods html; Examining and estimating spatial variability typically proceeds in several steps. In SAS, these can all be accomplished using PROC VARIOGRAM. In this first step, we summarize the potential distances (lags) between row/column positions. The nhclasses option sets a value for the number of lag classes or bins to try. Some trial and error here may be necessary to find a good setting, however, this value should be big enough to cover the range of possible distances between data row and column coordinates. Setting this to 40 was found to be a reasonable value here. The novariogram option tells SAS to only look at these distances and not compute the empirical semivariance values yet. /* Examine lag distance &amp; maxlag */ ODS html GPATH = &quot;.\\img\\&quot; ; proc variogram data=residuals; compute novariogram nhclasses=40; coordinates xc=row yc=col; var resid; run; Dependent Variable: Resid Number of Observations Read 224 Number of Observations Used 224 Pairs Information Number of Lags 41 Lag Distance 1.25 Maximum Data Distance in row 43.00 Maximum Data Distance in col 25.20 Maximum Data Distance 49.84 Pairwise Distance Intervals LagClass Bounds Number of Pairs Percentageof Pairs 0 0.00 0.62 0 0.00% 1 0.62 1.87 210 0.84% 2 1.87 3.12 199 0.80% 3 3.12 4.36 387 1.55% 4 4.36 5.61 917 3.67% 5 5.61 6.85 832 3.33% 6 6.85 8.10 462 1.85% 7 8.10 9.35 1571 6.29% 8 9.35 10.59 1215 4.86% 9 10.59 11.84 615 2.46% 10 11.84 13.08 1252 5.01% 11 13.08 14.33 1563 6.26% 12 14.33 15.58 910 3.64% 13 15.58 16.82 867 3.47% 14 16.82 18.07 1805 7.23% 15 18.07 19.31 1058 4.24% 16 19.31 20.56 873 3.50% 17 20.56 21.81 1352 5.41% 18 21.81 23.05 935 3.74% 19 23.05 24.30 943 3.78% 20 24.30 25.54 517 2.07% 21 25.54 26.79 1439 5.76% 22 26.79 28.04 513 2.05% 23 28.04 29.28 387 1.55% 24 29.28 30.53 868 3.48% 25 30.53 31.77 555 2.22% 26 31.77 33.02 350 1.40% 27 33.02 34.27 172 0.69% 28 34.27 35.51 770 3.08% 29 35.51 36.76 259 1.04% 30 36.76 38.00 188 0.75% 31 38.00 39.25 362 1.45% 32 39.25 40.50 207 0.83% 33 40.50 41.74 147 0.59% 34 41.74 42.99 59 0.24% 35 42.99 44.23 117 0.47% 36 44.23 45.48 49 0.20% 37 45.48 46.73 30 0.12% 38 46.73 47.97 11 0.04% 39 47.97 49.22 7 0.03% 40 49.22 50.46 3 0.01% This output indicates that, with 40 bins, the minimum lag distance is approximately 1.2m and that the maximum lag distances vary from 25 to 43m in rows and columns, respectively. The histogram graphically displays the number of pairs at each lag distance bin. Ideally, we want bins that have at least 30 pairs to improve accuracy in estimation of the empirical semivariance. There is sufficient data here such that setting the maximum lag to 30 results in bins that have much more than 30 pairs and will provide an accurate estimate of semivariance. 6.2.2 Compute Morans I and Gearys C. Two common metrics of spatial correlation are Morans I and Gearys C. Both these measures are essentially weighted correlations between pairs of observations and measure global and local variability, respectively. If no spatial correlation is present, Morans I has an expected value close to 0.0 while Gearys C will be close to 1.0. The estimates for I and C can be computed and tested against these null values with the PROC VARIOGRAM code below.

This type of pattern is very common for spatial relationships. 6.3.2 Fitting an Empirical Variogram Model In Section 3, several theoretical variogram models were described. We can use PROC VARIOGRAM to fit and compare any number of these models. In the code below, the Gaussian, Exponential, Power, and Spherical models are fit using the model statement. SAS, by default, will carry out a more sophisticated spatial modeling approach, not covered here, that uses combinations of these models. We, however, just want to focus on single model scenarios. Hence, the nest=1 option is given which restricts the variogram modeling to single models only.

The AIC statistic can be used as a guide where smaller values indicate a better fit. For this data, the Gaussian model is rated as best, although the Spherical model is practically indistinguishable. Given the numerically lower AIC value, however, PROC VARIOGRAM selects the Gaussian model and reports the model parameter estimates in the final table. These parameter estimates will be used in the next step. The plot shown at the end shows how well each variogram model fits the binned semivariance values. 6.4 Using the Estimated variogram in an Adjusted Analysis The previous steps have: 1. Diagnosed the presence and pattern of spatial variability. 1. Identified and estimated the a model to describe the variability The last step is to utilize this information in a statistical analysis as outlined at the beginning of Section 3. To do this, the linear mixed model procedure PROC MIXED will be used to incorporate the spatial variability into the linear model variance-covariance matrix, assuming the variogram model identified above. As an intial step, for comparison purposes, the unadjusted RCB model is run first and the means saved in data set NIN_RCBD_means. 6.4.1 Unadjusted RCBD Model /** Fit unadjusted RCBD model **/ ODS html GPATH = &quot;.\\img\\&quot; ; proc mixed data=alliance ; class entry rep; model yield = entry ; random rep; lsmeans entry/cl; ods output LSMeans=NIN_RCBD_means; title1 &#39;NIN data: RCBD&#39;; run; NIN data: RCBD Model Information Data Set WORK.ALLIANCE Dependent Variable yield Covariance Structure Variance Components Estimation Method REML Residual Variance Method Profile Fixed Effects SE Method Model-Based Degrees of Freedom Method Containment Class Level Information Class Levels Values entry 56 Arapahoe Brule Buckskin Centura Centurk7 Cheyenne Cody Colt Gage Homestea KS831374 Lancer Lancota NE83404 NE83406 NE83407 NE83432 NE83498 NE83T12 NE84557 NE85556 NE85623 NE86482 NE86501 NE86503 NE86507 NE86509 NE86527 NE86582 NE86606 NE86607 NE86T666 NE87403 NE87408 NE87409 NE87446 NE87451 NE87457 NE87463 NE87499 NE87512 NE87513 NE87522 NE87612 NE87613 NE87615 NE87619 NE87627 Norkan Redland Roughrid Scout66 Siouxlan TAM107 TAM200 Vona rep 4 R1 R2 R3 R4 Dimensions Covariance Parameters 2 Columns in X 57 Columns in Z 4 Subjects 1 Max Obs per Subject 224 Number of Observations Number of Observations Read 224 Number of Observations Used 224 Number of Observations Not Used 0 Iteration History Iteration Evaluations -2 Res Log Like Criterion 0 1 1240.74178756 1 1 1217.70153249 0.00000000 Convergence criteria met.

The AIC value for this standard RCBD analysis is 1221.7; lets compare that number to that for the spatially-adjusted models (in the case of AIC, smaller numbers indicate a better fitting model). Another point of comparison he standard error of the means is 3.8557. The next step is to try a spatially-adjusted model. This is done by adding a repeated statement specifying the spatial model form (Gaussian, type=sp(gau)) and the variables related to position in the study (row, col). The local option tells SAS to use a nugget parameter in the Gaussian variogram model. The second additional statement is parms. This gives SAS a starting place for estimating the range, sill, and nugget parameters. The values given here are taken from the PROC VARIOGRAM output above. While this step can be omitted, it is recommended not to do so because, on its own, PROC MIXED can often have trouble narrowing in on reasonable parameter estimates. One reason for the preceding variogram steps is to obtain these parameter values so PROC MIXED has a good starting place for estimation. As before, the estimated means (adjusted now) are saved, this time in data set NIN_Spatial_means. 6.4.2 RCBD Model with Spatial Covariates /** Fit Gaussian adjusted model **/ /** Parms statement order: Range, Sill, Nugget **/ /** Model option &quot;local&quot; forces nugget into model **/ ODS html GPATH = &quot;.\\img\\&quot; ; proc mixed data=alliance maxiter=150; class entry; model yield = entry /ddfm=kr; repeated/subject=intercept type=sp(gau) (Row Col) local; parms (11) (22) (19); lsmeans entry/cl; ods output LSMeans=NIN_Spatial_means; title1 &#39;NIN data: Gaussian Spatial Adjustment&#39;; run; NIN data: Gaussian Spatial Adjustment Model Information Data Set WORK.ALLIANCE Dependent Variable yield Covariance Structure Spatial Gaussian Subject Effect Intercept Estimation Method REML Residual Variance Method Profile Fixed Effects SE Method Kenward-Roger Degrees of Freedom Method Kenward-Roger Class Level Information Class Levels Values entry 56 Arapahoe Brule Buckskin Centura Centurk7 Cheyenne Cody Colt Gage Homestea KS831374 Lancer Lancota NE83404 NE83406 NE83407 NE83432 NE83498 NE83T12 NE84557 NE85556 NE85623 NE86482 NE86501 NE86503 NE86507 NE86509 NE86527 NE86582 NE86606 NE86607 NE86T666 NE87403 NE87408 NE87409 NE87446 NE87451 NE87457 NE87463 NE87499 NE87512 NE87513 NE87522 NE87612 NE87613 NE87615 NE87619 NE87627 Norkan Redland Roughrid Scout66 Siouxlan TAM107 TAM200 Vona Dimensions Covariance Parameters 3 Columns in X 57 Columns in Z 0 Subjects 1 Max Obs per Subject 224 Number of Observations Number of Observations Read 224 Number of Observations Used 224 Number of Observations Not Used 0 Parameter Search CovP1 CovP2 CovP3 Variance Res Log Like -2 Res Log Like 11.0000 22.0000 19.0000 25.3339 -555.0999 1110.1998 Iteration History Iteration Evaluations -2 Res Log Like Criterion 1 2 1098.19938899 0.55691103 2 2 1073.55589724 0.01698755 3 2 1070.40479989 0.00621291 4 1 1067.58247826 0.00103523 5 1 1067.13250829 0.00007623 6 1 1067.10196425 0.00000066 7 1 1067.10171375 0.00000000 Convergence criteria met.

This is substantially lower than the AIC=1221.7 from the unadjusted model indicating a better model fit. Additionally, the gen effect in the model now has a low p-value (p=0.0024) giving evidence for differences among genotypes where we did not see them previously. Lastly, the standard errors for the means are now lower than those of the unadjusted model indicating an increased precision in mean estimation. Presence of spatial variability can also bias the mean estimates. In this data, this would result in the means ranking incorrectly relative to one another under the unadjusted model. The steps below combine the saved means from the unadjusted and adjusted data sets so that we can see how the ranking changes. 6.5 Compare Estimated Means data NIN_RCBD_means (drop=tvalue probt alpha estimate stderr lower upper df); set NIN_RCBD_means; RCBD_estimate = estimate; RCBD_stderr = stderr; run; data NIN_Spatial_means (drop=tvalue probt alpha estimate stderr lower upper df); set NIN_Spatial_means; Spatial_estimate = estimate; Spatial_stderr = stderr; run; proc sort data=NIN_RCBD_means; by entry; run; proc sort data=NIN_Spatial_means; by entry; run; data compare; merge NIN_RCBD_means NIN_Spatial_means; by entry; run; proc rank data=compare out=compare descending; var RCBD_estimate Spatial_estimate; ranks RCBD_Rank Spatial_Rank; run; proc sort data=compare; by Spatial_rank; run; proc print data=compare; var entry rcbd_estimate Spatial_estimate rcbd_rank spatial_rank; run; Obs entry RCBD_estimate Spatial_estimate RCBD_Rank Spatial_Rank 1 Buckskin 25.5625 35.6362 28 1 2 NE83498 30.1250 29.7725 6 2 3 NE87619 31.2625 29.3455 2 3 4 NE87612 21.8000 28.9563 45 4 5 NE85556 26.3875 28.6144 23 5 6 NE87613 29.4000 28.2664 10 6 7 Redland 30.5000 28.2315 4 7 8 NE86606 29.7625 28.0865 8 8 9 NE86503 32.6500 27.8735 1 9 10 NE86507 23.7875 27.8365 39 10 11 Centurk7 30.3000 27.2432 5 11 12 Arapahoe 29.4375 27.0657 9 12 13 Brule 26.0750 27.0363 25 13 14 KS831374 24.1250 26.9109 37 14 15 NE87409 21.3750 26.8337 50 15 16 Scout66 27.5250 26.6969 17 16 17 NE83406 24.2750 26.5136 36 17 18 Siouxlan 30.1125 26.4493 7 18 19 NE86607 29.3250 26.4158 11 19 20 Roughrid 21.1875 26.3372 53 20 21 NE83407 22.6875 26.0105 43 21 22 Colt 27.0000 25.7772 19 22 23 Vona 23.6000 25.6633 40 23 24 NE86501 30.9375 25.4990 3 24 25 NE86527 22.0125 25.4641 44 25 26 NE83404 27.3875 25.4502 18 26 27 Centura 21.6500 25.4196 47 27 28 NE87408 26.3000 25.1692 24 28 29 Cheyenne 28.0625 25.0592 14 29 30 Gage 24.5125 25.0110 33 30 31 NE87451 24.6125 24.8679 31 31 32 NE86482 24.2875 24.7351 35 32 33 NE87615 25.6875 24.6426 27 33 34 NE85623 21.7250 24.2722 46 34 35 NE87457 23.9125 24.1953 38 35 36 Cody 21.2125 24.0971 52 36 37 NE87463 25.9125 24.0642 26 37 38 NE86582 24.5375 24.0511 32 38 39 Lancer 28.5625 23.6478 12 39 40 Norkan 24.4125 23.2929 34 40 41 NE87512 23.2500 23.2063 41 41 42 TAM107 28.4000 23.1066 13 42 43 NE86509 26.8500 22.7981 20 43 44 NE87446 27.6750 22.6374 15 44 45 NE87499 20.4125 22.4493 55 45 46 NE83432 19.7250 22.3448 56 46 47 NE87403 25.1250 22.3379 29 47 48 Homestea 27.6375 22.1425 16 48 49 NE87513 26.8125 22.1161 21 49 50 NE83T12 21.5625 21.9692 48 50 51 NE84557 20.5250 21.8553 54 51 52 Lancota 26.5500 21.7590 22 52 53 NE87522 25.0000 20.3275 30 53 54 NE87627 23.2250 19.7546 42 54 55 TAM200 21.2375 19.2002 51 55 56 NE86T666 21.5375 17.8942 49 56 This comparison shows some clear changes in rank. In his discussion of this data, Stroup (Stroup 2013), writes:  Buckskin was a variety known to be a high-yielding benchmark; its mediocre mean yield in the RCB analysis despite being observed in the field outperforming all varieties in the vicinity was one symptom that the RCB analysis was giving nonsense results.  Stroup (2013) This high expectation for Buckskin is realized in the adjusted analysis. Likewise, other varieties, such as NE87612 that ranked near the bottom in the RCB analysis, ranked as number 4 in the adjusted analysis. Of the top 10 varieties identified in the adjusted analysis, only 6 are found in the top 10 of the unadjusted RCB analysis. These changes in rank illustrate why consideration of spatial variability in agricultural trials is important.

However, it does not estimate the parameter \\(\\rho\\). The user must specify the \\(\\rho\\) and that value is not optimized in the restricted maximum likelihood estimation. There may be another way to implement the AR1xAR1 spatial model using the package TMB. Both SAS and Asreml can implement a mixed model with this covariance structure. A spAMM tutorial is available for exploring this package more. 8.2 Final recommendations Spatial analysis is a big topic, but I think it is worth the effort to learn and implement in analysis of field trials. This guide provides some minimal recipes for how to incorporate spatial information into field trial statistical analysis. There is no denying that work is needed to develop scripts that automate this process so researchers can routinely incorporate spatial covariance into field trial analysis. Many current R tools are unwieldy to use and have insufficient options to support variety trial analysis. Until this situation is improved, it is probably wisest to focus on using spatial models that are well-supported at this time. Any of the options implemented in the nlme package (or that work with that package) are decent choices with excellent support for extracting least-squares means, running ANOVA, and standard model diagnostics. Furthermore, nlme supports generalized linear models. Investigating spatial correlation in a field trial and controlling for it if necessary is recommended over doing nothing. sessionInfo() ## R version 4.0.5 (2021-03-31) ## Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit) ## Running under: Windows 10 x64 (build 19042) ## ## Matrix products: default ## ## locale: ## [1] LC_COLLATE=English_United States.1252 ## [2] LC_CTYPE=English_United States.1252 ## [3] LC_MONETARY=English_United States.1252 ## [4] LC_NUMERIC=C ## [5] LC_TIME=English_United States.1252 ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] stats graphics grDevices datasets utils methods base ## ## other attached packages: ## [1] SASmarkdown_0.4.3 psych_2.1.3 reshape2_1.4.4 SpATS_1.0-12 ## [5] lme4_1.1-26 Matrix_1.3-2 spaMM_3.7.2 emmeans_1.5.5-1 ## [9] gstat_2.0-7 purrr_0.3.4 spdep_1.1-5 sf_0.9-8 ## [13] spData_0.3.8 sp_1.4-5 nlme_3.1-152 desplot_1.8 ## [17] tidyr_1.1.3 dplyr_1.0.5 agridat_1.18 ggplot2_3.3.3 ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] TH.data_1.0-10 minqa_1.2.4 colorspace_2.0-0 ## [4] deldir_0.2-10 ellipsis_0.3.1 class_7.3-18 ## [7] estimability_1.3 proxy_0.4-25 farver_2.1.0 ## [10] fansi_0.4.2 mvtnorm_1.1-1 codetools_0.2-18 ## [13] splines_4.0.5 mnormt_2.0.2 knitr_1.31 ## [16] spam_2.6-0 jsonlite_1.7.2 nloptr_1.2.2.2 ## [19] pbkrtest_0.5.1 broom_0.7.5 compiler_4.0.5 ## [22] backports_1.2.1 assertthat_0.2.1 cli_2.3.1 ## [25] htmltools_0.5.1.1 tools_4.0.5 dotCall64_1.0-1 ## [28] coda_0.19-4 gtable_0.3.0 glue_1.4.2 ## [31] gmodels_2.18.1 Rcpp_1.0.7 slam_0.1-48 ## [34] jquerylib_0.1.3 raster_3.4-5 vctrs_0.3.7 ## [37] gdata_2.18.0 xfun_0.22 stringr_1.4.0 ## [40] lifecycle_1.0.0 renv_0.13.2 gtools_3.8.2 ## [43] statmod_1.4.35 ROI_1.0-0 LearnBayes_2.15.1 ## [46] MASS_7.3-53.1 zoo_1.8-9 scales_1.1.1 ## [49] parallel_4.0.5 sandwich_3.0-0 expm_0.999-6 ## [52] yaml_2.2.1 pbapply_1.4-3 sass_0.3.1 ## [55] stringi_1.5.3 highr_0.8 e1071_1.7-6 ## [58] boot_1.3-27 intervals_0.15.2 rlang_0.4.10 ## [61] pkgconfig_2.0.3 evaluate_0.14 lattice_0.20-41 ## [64] labeling_0.4.2 tidyselect_1.1.0 plyr_1.8.6 ## [67] magrittr_2.0.1 bookdown_0.21 R6_2.5.0 ## [70] generics_0.1.0 multcomp_1.4-16 DBI_1.1.1 ## [73] pillar_1.5.1 withr_2.4.1 units_0.7-1 ## [76] xts_0.12.1 survival_3.2-10 tibble_3.1.0 ## [79] spacetime_1.2-4 crayon_1.4.1 KernSmooth_2.23-18 ## [82] utf8_1.2.1 tmvnsim_1.0-2 rmarkdown_2.7 ## [85] grid_4.0.5 data.table_1.14.0 FNN_1.1.3 ## [88] digest_0.6.27 classInt_0.4-3 xtable_1.8-4 ## [91] numDeriv_2016.8-1.1 munsell_0.5.0 registry_0.5-1 ## [94] bslib_0.2.4 Stroup, Walter W. 2013.
